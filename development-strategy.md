# Project Development Strategy

## `Debugging-Project-WEEK 2: Prompt-Alert-Calculate`

### Description

This is a collaborative HTML, CSS and JavaScript project. It consists of single dynamic webpage and 6 JS functions with the appropriate handlers. JavaScripts use a single global variable.
It could be useful to boost team-developing skills, to practice JavaScript, HTML and CSS3 frameworks and to get used to develop scripts in a test-based environment.

It could be used to understand pure JavaScript examples.

> For this project we use an incremental development pattern, according to which each issue (UI or JS function) was developed in its own Git branch, reviewed and then added to the main project.

### 0. Set-Up

#### Assigned to: [gelilaa](https://github.com/gelilaa)

> On this step the project repo was generated from template.

Steps:

- Generate repo from template
- Turn on GitHub Pages
- Written initial, basic README
- Development-strategy file created

### 1. Creating UI

#### Assigned to: [pavelbidenko2018](https://github.com/pavelbidenko2018)

> On this step entire UI was set up. So the user can see a styled web page with a set of buttons each of which will be linked with JS function handler.

Steps:

- A new repo branch `html-css` was created.
- HTML markup was developed.
- CSS styling was added.
- The GitHub pull request was reviewed by reviewers and the branch was merged to the `master` branch.

### 2. Developing `Add` function and its handler.

#### Assigned to: [gelilaa](https://github.com/gelilaa)

> On this step user can run a function `Add` by pressing on appropriate button.  
> This function adds up the previous set number with the user input.

Steps:

- The new repo branch `Add`was generated
- The core logic function was developed
- It was passed through a set of tests
- An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interactively.
- PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch
  was merged to the `master` branch.

### 3. Developing `Subtract` function and its handler.

#### Assigned to: [LujiAnna](https://github.com/LujiAnna)

> On this step user can run a function `Subtract` by pressing on appropriate button.  
> This function subtracts the user input from the previously set number.

Steps:

- The new repo branch `subtract`was generated.
- The core logic function was developed
- It was passed through a set of tests
- An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interactively.
- PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch
  was merged to the `master` branch.

### 4. Developing `multiply` function and its handler.

#### Assigned to: [fmkarakus](https://github.com/fmkarakus)

> On this step user can run a function `multiply` by pressing on appropriate button.  
> This function multiplies the user input by the previously set number.

Developing steps are similar to the previous:

- The new repo branch `multiply` was generated.
- The core logic function was developed.
- It was passed through a set of tests.
- An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interactively.
- PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch.
  was merged to the `master` branch.

### 5. Developing `divide` function and its handler.

#### Assigned to: [fmkarakus](https://github.com/fmkarakus)

> On this step user can run a function `divide` by pressing on appropriate button.  
> This function divides the previously set number by the user input.

Developing steps are similar to the the all project issues which concern JavaScript development:

- The new repo branch `divide`was generated.
- The core logic function was developed.
- It was passed through a set of tests.
- An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interactively.
- PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch.
  was merged to the `master` branch.

### 6. Writing "readme.md".

#### Assigned to: [LujiAnna](https://github.com/LujiAnna)

- README file was completed in the separate branch `readme` which was reviewed and merged to the `master`

### 7. Finishing Touches

#### Assigned to: [pavelbidenko2018](https://github.com/pavelbidenko2018)

On this step:

- W3C code validation made
- Bug and error fixes
